If there are *m* possible outcomes for the first stage and, for each of these outcomes, there are n possible outcomes for the second stage then there are $mn$ possible outcomes.\n\nFor example, car can be ordered in three styles and one of four paint colors. There are 12 possible options.\n\n### Example 4.9\n\nTwo dice are are tossed - how many simple events are in sample space *S*?\n\n### Example 4.10\n\nA candy dish contains one yellow and two red candies - if you draw two candies *without replacement*, how many simple events are there.\n\n### Extended *mn* rule\n\nIf there are *k* stages with $n_i$ possible outcomes at each stage then the number of possible outcomes for the experiment is\n\n$$\nn_1n_2n_3\\dots n_k = \\prod_{i=1}^k n_k\n$$\n\n### Example 4.12\n\nA truck driver can take:\n\n-   3 routes from city A to B\n\n-   4 routes from B to C\n\n-   3 routes from C to D\n\nHow many total routes can they take from A to B to C to D?\n\n### Counting rule for permutations\n\nOrders or permutations, Let's say you have 3 books how can you arrange two of them on a shelf? How about 3 books?\n\nFactorial Notation:\n\nThe number of ways we can arrange \\*n\\_ distinct objects, taking them *r* at a time is\n\n$$\nP^{n}_r = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\n$$\n\n$$\nn! = n(n-1)(n-2)\\dots(3)(2)(1)\n$$\n\nNote that $0! \\equiv 1$\n\n### Example 4.13\n\nThree lottery tickets are drawn from a total of 50 by three employees - How many simple events are associated with the experiment?\n\n### A counting rule for combinations\n\nWhat happens when you don't care about the ordering of some items?\n\nFor example, we talked about how to arrange 2 books of 3 on a bookshelf. What if we didn't care about the order and just wanted to pick 2 of 3 books?\n\n$$\nC^{n}_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n$$\n\n### Example 4.15\n\nA printed circuit board may be purchased from five suppliers - how many ways can three suppliers be chosen?\n\n### Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.5-12, 4.13-4.19, 4.21, 4.22, 4.24, 4.3.28, 4.3.29\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Chapter 4 - Section 3](/homework/chapter-04.qmd#section-4.3)",
