The variable *x* can take on any of six values - 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\n*x* is a random variable if the value that it assumes, corresponding to the outcome an experiment, is a chance or random event.\n\n-   what are some examples of random variables?\n\n-   This chapter focuses on *discrete* random variables.\n\n### Probability Distribution\n\n-   relative frequency distribution (sample)\n-   **probability distribution** is the relative frequency distribution constructed for the entire population of measurements.\n-   *p(x)* is the probability associated with value *x*\n\nRequirements for a discrete probability distribution\n\n-   $0 \\le p(x) \\le 1$\n\n-   $\\sum p(x) = 1$\n\n### Example 5.1\n\nToss two fair coins and let x equal the number of heads observed. Find the probability distribution for x.\n\n-   table with x, number of heads, simple events and p(x)\n\n-   draw histogram with this information\n\n### The Mean and Standard Deviation for a Discrete Random Variable\n\nPopulation mean or *expected value*.\n\nSuppose you the experiment is repeated a large number of times - say 4,000,000. How can we calculate the average?\n\nDefinition:\n\n$$\n\\mu = E(x) = \\sum x p(x)\n$$\n\nRepeat previous example but with 3 coin flips\n\nYou can also do the same thing for the population variance\n\n$$\n\\sum(x - \\mu)^2p(x)\n$$\n\nIn both cases you sum over all possible values of *x*\n\n### Example 5.2\n\nA big box store is selling laptops, they only have 4 in stock. Previously, the marketing department had defined a probability distribution for the number of laptops bought as below. What is the expected number of laptops bought and the variance. How likely is it the 5 will be bought?\n\n| x      | $p(x)$ | $xp(x)$ | $(x - \\mu)^2$ | $(x - \\mu)^2 p(x)$ |\n|--------|--------|---------|---------------|--------------------|\n| 0      | .1     |         |               |                    |\n| 1      | .4     |         |               |                    |\n| 2      | .2     |         |               |                    |\n| 3      | .15    |         |               |                    |\n| 4      | .1     |         |               |                    |\n| 5      | .05    |         |               |                    |\n| Totals |        |         |               |                    |\n\n### Example 5.3\n\nA lottery is conducted for a local charity, 8000 tickets are to be sold at \\$10 each. The prize it a \\$24,000 car. If you purchase two tickets, what is your expected gain?\n\nWhat are the two possible gains? What is the probability of each?\n\nWhat is the expected loss/gain?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Example 5.4\n\nAn insurance company needs to know how much to charge for a \\$100,000 policy insuring an event against cancellation due to inclement weather. The probability of inclement weather during the time of the event is assessed as 2 in 100. Once they find C, the cost of the policy to break event, they can add administrative costs and profit to this amount. Fin the value of C so that their expected gain is 0.\n\nx = Gain, C = premium.\n\nWhat are the two possibilities? What is the gain in each situation? What is the probability of each happening?\n\n-   What has been an implicit assumption throughout (most) of these examples? is 2/100 for example, always true?\n\n### Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"5.1.12-16, 5.1.29, 5.1.34\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Section 5.1](/homework/chapter-05.qmd#section-1)",
