If the two events are independent then $P(A|B) = P(A|B^c) = P(A)$\n\n### Example 4.20\n\nIn a color preference experiment, eight toys are placed in a container. The toys are identical except fo color - two are red, and six are green. A child is asked to choose two toys at random. What is the probability that the child chooses the two red toys?\n\n-   Use a tree diagram fo first and second choice\n-   $A = \\text{(R on first choice) } \\cap \\text{ (R on second choice)}$\n\n### Conditional Probabilities\n\nThe conditional probability of event *A* given that event *B* has occured is:\n\n$$\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)} \\text{  if  } P(B) \\neq 0\n$$\n\n$$\nP(B|A) = \\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(A)} \\text{  if  } P(A) \\neq 0\n$$\n\n### Colorblindness, continued\n\n|                        | Men($B$) | Women($B^c$) | Total |\n|------------------------|----------|--------------|-------|\n| Colorblind ($A$)       | .04      | .002         | .042  |\n| Not Colorblind ($A^c$) | .47      | .488         | .958  |\n| Total                  | .51      | .49          | 1     |\n\n-   If you pick a random person what is the chance they are colorblind?\n\n-   If you pick a random male, what is the chance he is colorblind?\n\n-   What is the chance a woman is?\n\n### The multiplication rule for independent events\n\nIf two events *A* and *B* are independent, the probability that *both* A and B occur is:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\n$$\n\nSame thing for more than two events:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B \\cap C) = P(A)P(B)P(C)\n$$\n\n### Coin tosses In a Row\n\n-   What the probability that the first toss is a heads, second toss is a tails, third toss is a heads?\n\n-   What about all three tosses being heads?\n\n### Checking for independence\n\nTwo events are said to be independent if and only if either:\n\n$$\nP(A\\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nP(B|A) = P(B)\n$$\n\n### Example 4.22\n\nRespondents were asked about the cost of a college education . The respondents were classified according to whether they currently had a chaild in college and whther they thought the loan burden for most college students is too high, the right amount or too little.\n\n|                         | Too High (A) | Right Amount (B) | Too Little (C) |\n|-------------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Child in College (D)    | .35          | .08              | .01            |\n| No Child in College (E) | .25          | .20              | .11            |\n\nIs A independent of D?\n\nAlso Remember the question about shooting free throw - is making the second one independent of making the first one?\n\n|            | Hit Second | Miss Second |\n|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Hit First  | .49        | .21         |\n| Miss First | .21        | .09         |\n\n### Mutually exclusive vs Independent\n\n### Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"4.4.1, 4.4.7-4.4.10, 4.4.14, 4.4.27, 4.4.29,4.4.32, 4.4.35\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Chapter 4 - Section 4](/homework/chapter-04.qmd#section-4.4)",
