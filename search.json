    "text": "Overview\nThis course is designed to give an overview of the key concepts in probability and statistics. We will cover new material every class according the tentative schedule below. There will be a short quiz once a week (generally Tuesdays) unless otherwise stated (we will have about 10 during the semester). Only the top 6 will count towards your grade - makeups will not be available. Suggested homework problem will be assigned.\nWe will primarily use calculators in this course for arithmatic. However, a number of calculations are not possible to do on a calculator or take too long (adding 100 numbers for example). We will therefore learn how to do a lot of the work in the Excel as well. If there is interest/time I will also show how some work may be done using R (a programming language).i"

An affordable calculator that I recommend is the TI-30X IIS. It sells for $15.99 on Amazon. Graphing calculators can also be borrowed from the library for free. Your cell phone cannot be used as a calculator during a quiz/exam."
