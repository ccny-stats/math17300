It is known from prior studies that the standard deviation of the average daily ields is $\\sigma \\approx 21$. How many measurements should be included in his sample?\n\n\n$$\n1.96 \\text{ SE} < 4\n$$\n\n$$\n1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} < 4\n$$\n\n\nSolve for n\n\n$$\nn > (\\frac{1.96}{4})^2 \\sigma^2\n$$\n\n$$\nn > 105.9\n$$\n\n\n- You must somehow get an estimate of $\\sigma$ from a prior sample? Or use range approximation.\n\n### Example 8.14\n\nWhat do we do with binoomial? We need to assume a rate of p.\n\nProducers of PVC pipe want to have a supply of pipes sufficient to meet marketing needs, they want to estimate the proportion of wholesalers who plan to increase their purchases next year. What sample size is required if they want their estimate to be within .04 of the actual proportion with probability equal to .9?\n\n\n- $\\alpha = .1$\n\n$$\n1.645 \\sqrt{\\frac{pq}{n}} < .04\n$$\n\n$$\np = .5\n$$\n\nwill give largest sample\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\nn must be greater than 422.7\n\n\n### Example 8.15\n\nA personnel director wishes to compare the effectiveness of two methods for training employees to performa a certain assemply operation. Assmply methods are tested one against another. Two groups are made and the _range_ is expected to be about 8 minutes. How many workers must be included in each training group to estimate the difference in means to within 1 minute with a probability equal to .95.\n\n\nAssume $\\sigma = 2$ for each group.\n\n$$\n1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}} \\le 1\n$$\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma\\\\\nn_1 = n_2 = n\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}} \\le 1\n$$\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n$$\nn \\ge 31\n$$\n\n## Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"8.7.1, 8.7.9, 8.7.15\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Section 8.7](/homework/chapter-08.qmd#section-7)",
