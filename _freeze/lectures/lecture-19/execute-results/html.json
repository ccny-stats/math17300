The approximation will be adequate if $np > 5$ and $nq > 5$.\n\n### Example 7.10\n\n-   500 parents asked about the importance of sports for boys and girls. Of the parents interviewed, 60% agreed that boys and girls should have equal opportunities to participate in sports. Describe the sampling distribution of the sample proportion $\\hat p$ of parents who agree that boys and girls should have equal opportunities.\n\n$$ \n\\text{SE}(\\hat p) = \\sqrt{ \\frac {pq}{n}} \\approx \\sqrt{ \\frac {\\hat p \\hat q}{n}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac {.6 * .4}{500}} = .022\n$$\n\nCreate 95% Interval\n\n-   95% of the time, $\\hat p$ will fall within 2SE $\\approx .044$ of the unknown value of $p$\n\n-   This is the first time we have *estimated* a parameter from the data - and estimated the uncertainty around the estimate.\n\n-   We have generally reversed the situation and assumed a population proportion $p$ and calculated the probability of how likely or unlikely a sample proportion $\\hat p$ might be.\n\n### Example 7.11\n\nSuppose someone claims that the proportion $p$ of parents in the population is actually .55. What is the probability of observing a sample proportion as large as or larger than $\\hat p = .6$\n\n$$ \n\\text{SE}(\\hat p) = \\sqrt{ \\frac {pq}{n}}  = \\sqrt{ \\frac {.55 * .45}{500}} = .0222\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-19_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n$$\nz = \\frac{\\hat p - p}{\\sqrt{pq/n}} = \\frac{.6 - .55}{.0222} = 2.25\n$$\n\n$$\nP(\\hat p > .6) \\approx P(z > 2.25) = 1 - .9878 = .0122\n$$\n\nWith continuity correction:\n\n$$\nz_1 = \\frac{(.6 - .5/500) - .55}{.0222} = 2.20\n$$\n\n### Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"7.5.27\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Section 7.5](/homework/chapter-07.qmd#section-5)",
