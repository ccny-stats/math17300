There will be a short quiz once a week (generally Tuesdays) unless otherwise stated (we will have about 10 during the semester). Only the top 6 will count towards your grade - makeups will not be available. Suggested homework problem will be assigned.\nWe will primarily use calculators in this course for arithmatic. However, a number of calculations are not possible to do on a calculator or take too long (adding 100 numbers for example). We will therefore learn how to do a lot of the work in the Excel as well. If there is interest/time I will also show how some work may be done using R (a programming language)."
