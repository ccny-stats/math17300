## Section 5.2 The Binomial Probability Distribution

A binomial experiment is one that has these five characteristics:

1.  The experiment consists of *n* identical trials
2.  Each trial results in one of two outcomes. Success (S) and Failure (F)
3.  Probability of success is always equal to *p* and probability of failure is $1 - p = q$.
4.  The trials are independent
5.  The binomial random variable *x* is the number of successes in *n* trials.

-   If you select 1000 people and ask them if they like basketball - is this a binomial experiment?

-   If you have 20 balls, 10 red and 10 blue - and you pick 4. Is the number of red balls that you pick the result of a binomial experiment?

### The binoomial Probability Distribution

$$
P(x = k) = C^n_k p^k q^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} p^k q^{n-k}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu &= np \\
\sigma^2 &= npq \\
\sigma & = \sqrt{npq}
\end{aligned}
$$


### Example 5.7

Let's say a basketball player can make free throws with a probability of 80%. If she shoots 10 shots, what's the probability that she makes exactly 8.

if p = .8 and n = 10, find P(x = 8)

1.  What is one way that we can observe 8 successes and 2 failures?
2.  What's the probability of that happening?
3.  Can we observed 8 successes and 2 failures any other way?

Histograms for different values of *p*

```{r}
x <- 0:10

expand.grid(x = x, p = c(.2, .5, .8)) |> 
dplyr::mutate(p_x = dbinom(x, size = 10, prob = p)) |> 
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = p_x, fill = as.factor(p))) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity") + facet_wrap(~p, labeller = "label_both") +
labs(fill = "") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = x)
```

```{r}
binom_data <- expand.grid(x = x, p = c(.2, .5, .8)) |> 
dplyr::mutate(p_x = dbinom(x, size = 10, prob = p)) |> 
dplyr::mutate(p_x = round(p_x, 3)) |> 
tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = p, values_from = p_x)  

binom_data |> 
flextable::flextable() |> 
flextable::set_caption("Binomial Distribution for n = 10 with various values of p")

```

What if I now ask - what is the probability of making at least 6? ($P(x \ge 6)$)

What about $P(x \lt 6)$?

### Cumulative Binomial Probabilities

$$
P(\le 3) = p(0) + p(1) + p(2) + p(3)
$$

```{r}
expand.grid(x = x, p = c(.2, .5, .8)) |> 
dplyr::mutate(p_x = dbinom(x, size = 10, prob = p)) |> 
tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = p, values_from = p_x)  |> 
dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(-x, cumsum)) |> 
dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(-x, \(x) round(x,3))) |> 
flextable::flextable() |> 
flextable::set_caption("Cumulative Binomial probabilities for n = 10 with various values of p")

```

Let's look at the column where p = 0.2, how do you find

-   $P(x \le 2)$?
-   $P(x \gt 2)$?
-   $P(x = 2)$?
-   $P( 3 \le x \lt 6)$?

See the table 1 in appendix I (pg 682)

Use the table for n = 5, p = 0.6.

Find probability of exactly 3 successes

Find probability of three or more successes

### Example 5.11

Let's assume someone is interested in testing if vitamin C help prevent the common cold during the winter. Let's assume that the probability of making it through the winter without experiencing the common cold = 0.5.

You give 10 people vitamin C and only 2 get sick. What is the probability that only 2 or fewer folks get sick if the probability of getting sick is 0.5?
