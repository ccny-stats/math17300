If you are asking the probability of someone being 6 feet tall, what you really want to know is what's the probability that they are greater than 5'11 1/2 and less than 6'0 1/2.\n\n-   The next thing to deal with is what probability density function should you pick for your data? It's not like with the discrete case where we could just list out the probabilities of specific number\n\n### Continuous Uniform Probability Distribution\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{b - a} \\text{ for } a \\le x \\le b\n$$\n\nx can only run from a to b\n\n*a* and \\*b are parameters\n\nNotice that the distribution is *constant* - does not change no matter what value of x we plug in\n\n(Draw Figure 6.3) - Uniform Probability distribution\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{b-a}{2}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{(b - a)^2}{12}\n$$\n\n### Example 6.1\n\nThe error introduced by rounding an observation to the nearest inch has a uniform distribution over the interval from -.5 to .5. What is the probability that the rounding error is less than .2 in absolute value (i.e., $-.2 \\lt x \\lt .2$)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-13_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The Exponential Probability Distribution\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} \\text{ for } x \\ge 0 \\text{ and } \\lambda > 0\n$$\n\n-   $\\mu = 1/\\lambda$\n\n-   $\\sigma^2 = 1/\\lambda^2$\n\n$$\nP(x > a) = e^{-\\lambda a}\n$$\n\n### Example 6.2\n\nThe waiting time at a supermarket checkout counter has an exponential distribution with an average waiting time of 5 minutes. What is the probability that you will have to wait more than 10 minutes ath the checkout counter?\n\nHere we are given $\\mu$ - what is $\\lambda$?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-13_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"6.1.18, 6.1.19\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Section 6.1](/homework/chapter-06.qmd#section-1)",
