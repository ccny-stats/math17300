The probability distribution of x is approximated using a normal curve with:\n\n-   $\\mu = np$ and $\\sigma = \\sqrt{npq}$.\n\n-   This approximation is adequate as long as *n* is large and *p* is not too close to 0 or 1.\n\n### Figure 6.17\n\n-   n = 25, p = 0.5\n-   $\\mu = ?$\n-   $\\sigma = ?$\n-   compare the areas under the curve to the areas in the bar\n-   Example the curve between 7.5 and 10.5 is approximately $P(8 \\le x \\le 10)$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-15_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUse Binomial Probability? $$\nP(8 \\le x \\le 10) = .190\n$$\n\nUse Normal approximation (subtract .5 from lower end and add .5 to upper end)\n\n$$\nP(7.5 \\le x \\le 10.5) = .1891\n$$\n\n-   z-score\n\nThe 1/2 half adjustment is called a continuity correction and helps account for the effect that you are approximating a discrete random variable with a continuous one.\n\nRule of thumb:\n\n-   The normal approximation to the binomial probabilities will be adequate if both:\n-   $np >5$ and $nq >5$\n\n### Figure 6.18\n\n-   n = 25, p = .1\n-   $\\mu = ?$\n-   $\\sigma = ?$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-15_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Example 6.12\n\nThe reliability of an electrical fuse it he probability that a fuse, chosen at random from pdouction will function under its designed conditions. A random sample of 1000 fuses was tested and x = 27 defectives were observed. Calculate the approximate probablity of observing 27 or more defectives, assuming that the fuse reliability is .98.\n\n-   $\\mu = np = 1000*.02 = 20$\n\n-   $\\sigma = \\sqrt{npq} = 1000 * .02 * .98 = 19.6$\n\n-   Check if normal approximation is appropriate?\n\n-   Create z score for value of 26.5\n\n-   Normal approximation yields .0708\n\nUsing exact:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.0507\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Example 6.12\n\nA soda manufacturer was fairly certain that her brand had a 10% share of the market. In a survey involving 2500 soda drinkers, x = 211 preferred her brand. If the 10% figure is correct, find the probability of observing 211 or fewer consumers who perfer her brand of soda.\n\n-   $\\mu = 250$\n\n-   $\\sigma = 15$\n\n-   Z score for 211.5 = -2.57\n\n$$\nP(x \\le 211) \\approx P( z \\lt -2.57) = .0051\n$$\n\nExact binomial probability:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.0044\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat happened??\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\nEither observed an unusual sample even though p = 0.1 OR the sample reflects the value of p is less than .1 and perhaps closer to 21/2500 = .08\n\n### Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"6.3.13, 6.3.15, 6.3.24, 6.3.28\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Section 6.3](/homework/chapter-06.qmd#section-3)",
