If the two events are independent then $P(A|B) = P(A|B^c) = P(A)$\n\n### Example 4.20\n\nin a color preference experiment, eight toys are placed in a container. The toys are identical except fo color - two are red, and six are green. A child is asked to choose two toys at random. What is the probability that the child chooses the two red toys?\n\n- Use a tree diagram fo first and second choice\n- $A = \\text{(R on first choice) } \\cap \\text{ (R on second choice)}$\n\n\n\n### Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"4.4.1, 4.4.7-4.4.10, 4.4.14, 4.4.27, 4.4.29,4.4.32, 4.4.35\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Chapter 4 - Section 4](/homework/chapter-04.qmd#section-4.4)",
