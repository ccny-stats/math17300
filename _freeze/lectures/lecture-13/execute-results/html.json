If you are asking the probability of someone being 6 feet tall, what you really want to know is what's the probability that they are greater than 5'11 1/2 and less than 6'0 1/2.\n\n-   The next thing to deal with is what probability density function should you pick for your data? It's not like with the discrete case where we could just list out the probabilities of specific number\n\n### Continuous Uniform Probability Distribution\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{b - a} \\text{ for } a \\le x \\le b\n$$\n\nx can only run from a to b\n\n*a* and \\*b are parameters\n\nNotice that the distribution is *constant* - does not change no matter what value of x we plug in\n\n(Draw Figure 6.3) - Uniform Probability distribution\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{b+a}{2}\n$$\n\nNote: book has a typo that says $b - a$. The formula above is correct for $\\mu$.\n\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{(b - a)^2}{12}\n$$\n\n### Example 6.1\n\nThe error introduced by rounding an observation to the nearest inch has a uniform distribution over the interval from -.5 to .5. What is the probability that the rounding error is less than .2 in absolute value (i.e., $-.2 \\lt x \\lt .2$)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-13_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The Exponential Probability Distribution\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} \\text{ for } x \\ge 0 \\text{ and } \\lambda > 0\n$$\n\n-   $\\mu = 1/\\lambda$\n\n-   $\\sigma^2 = 1/\\lambda^2$\n\n$$\nP(x > a) = e^{-\\lambda a}\n$$\n\n### Example 6.2\n\nThe waiting time at a supermarket checkout counter has an exponential distribution with an average waiting time of 5 minutes. What is the probability that you will have to wait more than 10 minutes at the checkout counter?\n\nHere we are given $\\mu$ - what is $\\lambda$?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-13_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"6.1.18, 6.1.19\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Section 6.1](/homework/chapter-06.qmd#section-1)\n\n## Section 6.2 The Normal Probability Distribution\n\nThe normal probability distribution is a very common distribution because a lot of measurements follow this distribution at least approximately.\n\nThe pdf is defined by:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-(x - \\mu)^2/(2 \\sigma^2)}\n$$\n\n-   What are the parameters of the distribution?\n\n-   Some example of normal distributions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-13_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[Interactive Demo](https://shiny.stat.lsa.umich.edu/pvals/)\n\n### The Standard Normal Random Variable\n\nIt can be challenging to calculate area under the curve for the normal distribution because of the infinite number of combinations of $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$.\n\nWe would need a separate table for each combination!\n\nWe can deal with this by standardizing the data we get to a z-score.\n\n$$\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n$$\n\nThis is the equivalent of looking at a distribution that has $\\mu = 0$ and $\\sigma = 1$.\n\na portion of the table from the book is shown below.\n\nNote that the rows show z to the 10ths place and the columns show the 100ths place of z.\n\n![](images/paste-3.png)\n\nFind\n\n-   $P(z\\le -1.96)$\n\n-   $P(z\\lt -1.96)$\n\n-   $P(z\\gt -1.96)$\n\n-   What about $P(z > 1.96)$ ?\n\n\nz-score can also be thought of as the number of standard deviations a number is from the mean.\n\n### Example 6.8\n\nx is a normally distributed normal random variable with a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 2. Find the probability that x lies between 11 and 13.6?\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n11 \\le& x \\le 13.6 \\\\\n11 - 10 \\le& x - 10 \\le 13.6 - 10 \\\\\n\\frac{11 - 10}{2} \\le& \\frac{x - 10}{2} \\le 13.6 - 10 \\\\\n.5 \\le& z \\le 1.8\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n-   show how this is the same [using interactive tool](https://shiny.stat.lsa.umich.edu/pvals/)\n\n### Example 6.9\n\nGas mileage for compact cars is normally distributed with mean of 35.5 mpg and std of 4.5.\n\nWhat percentage of compacts get 40 mpg or more\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n\nConvert to z-score\n\nAnswer is 15.8%\n\n### Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"6.2.46-48, 6.2.68\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Section 6.2](/homework/chapter-06.qmd#section-2)",
