If you have a fair coin, the probability that you'd see 10 heads is very low. It's likely the coin is biased\n\n-   Two ways\n\n    -   probability of event when the population is known,\n    -   probability of inference given you observe a sample from the population\n\n## 4.1 Events and the sample space\n\n-   An **experiment** is the process by which an observation or measurement is obtained.\n\nExamples:\n\n-   Recording a test grade\n-   Measuring daily rainfall\n-   Recording a persons's opinion\n-   Any others??\n\nWhen an experiment is performed we observe an outcome called a **simple event** - Often written as $E_i$\n\nExample -\n\nWhat are the simple events that can happen when a 6 sided die is rolled?\n\n-   $E_1$ = 1\n-   $E_2$ = 2\n-   ...\n-   $E_6$ = 6\n\nAn **event** is a collection of simple events. for example:\n\n-   *A*: Observe an odd number: $A = \\{E_1, E_3, E_5\\}$\n-   *B*: Observe a number less than 4: $B = \\{E_1, E_2, E_3\\}$\n\nTwo events are **mutually exclusive** if when one event occurs the other cannot - and vise versa.\n\nNote that $A$ and $B$ are not mutually exclusive - why?\n\n-   What are some example of mutually exclusive events\n\n-   The set of all simple events i called the sample space , *S*\n\nVenn Diagram: (see page 129 of book) - Venn Diagram of die tossing, including all simple event and A/B\n\nSome examples:\n\n### Ex 4.2\n\nToss a simple coin - what are the simple events that define the sample space?\n\n### Ex. 4.3 & 4.4\n\nBlood Types (4 Simple Events)\n\nThese are mutually exclusive\n\n-   what about adding Rh factor - (positive/negative)\n-   Use a tree diagram to show how to come up with the simple events\n\n### Homework\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"4.1.1-6, 4.1.28\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswers: [Chapter 4 - Section 1](/homework/chapter-04.qmd#section-4.1)",
