Should we estimate it with the sample mean (\\(\\bar x\\)), maybe the median?\nThree main idea about choosing an estimator:\n\n\nIs it hard to calculate?\nDoes it produce estimates that are generally too high or too low?\nIs it more or less variable than other possible estimators?\n\nThe sample mean is best in this case. It’s easy to that of course it should be sample mean - however, think about our estimate of the population variance from the sample variance - the sample variance has a different formula.\n\nThe Sampling Distributino of the Sample Mean, \\(\\bar x\\)\nIf a random sample of n measurements is selected from a population with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), the sampling distribution of the sample mean \\(\\bar x\\) will have mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\).\n\nIf the population is normal, then the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar x\\) is normal no matter the size of \\(n\\).\nIf the population is nonnormal, then this works for \\(n \\ge 30\\)\n\n\n\n\nStandard Error of the Sample Mean\nThe standard deviation of a statistic used to estimate a population parameter is also called the standard error of the estimator. The standard error of \\(\\bar x\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\nIn order to calculate probabilities for the Sample Mean - we can convert to a z-score like we have done before - using the standard error for the denominator:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\bar x - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nNote that in this case we are given the population standard deviation. If we weren’t, we could calculate it from the sample and plug in \\(s\\) of \\(\\sigma\\) above.\n\n\nExample 7.4\nThe duration of Alzheimer’s disease from the time symptoms first appear until death ranges from 3 to 20 years; the average is 8 years with a standard deviation of 4 years. The administrator selects the medical records of 30 deceased Alzheimer’s patients from the medical center’s database and records the average duration.

There will be a short quiz once a week (generally Tuesdays) unless otherwise stated (we will have about 10 during the semester). Only the top 6 will count towards your grade - makeups will not be available. Suggested homework problem will be assigned.\nWe will primarily use calculators in this course for arithmatic. However, a number of calculations are not possible to do on a calculator or take too long (adding 100 numbers for example). We will therefore learn how to do a lot of the work in the Excel as well. If there is interest/time I will also show how some work may be done using R (a programming language)."
